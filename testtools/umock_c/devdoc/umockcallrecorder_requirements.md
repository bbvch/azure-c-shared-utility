##umockcallrecorder_create

```c
extern UMOCKCALLRECORDER_HANDLE umockcallrecorder_create(void);
```

**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_001: [** umockcallrecorder_create shall create a new instance of a call recorder and return a non-NULL handle to it on success. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_002: [** If allocating memory for the call recorder fails, umockcallrecorder_create shall return NULL. **]**

##umockcallrecorder_destroy

```c
extern void umockcallrecorder_destroy(UMOCKCALLRECORDER_HANDLE umock_call_recorder);
```

**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_003: [** umockcallrecorder_destroy shall free the resources associated with a the call recorder identified by the umock_call_recorder argument. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_004: [** If umock_call_recorder is NULL, umockcallrecorder_destroy shall do nothing. **]**

##umockcallrecorder_reset_all_calls

```c
extern int umockcallrecorder_reset_all_calls(UMOCKCALLRECORDER_HANDLE umock_call_recorder);
```

**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_005: [** umockcallrecorder_reset_all_calls shall free all the expected and actual calls for the call recorder identified by umock_call_recorder. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_006: [** On success umockcallrecorder_reset_all_calls shall return 0. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_007: [** If umock_call_recorder is NULL, umockcallrecorder_reset_all_calls shall fail and return a non-zero value. **]**

##umockcallrecorder_add_expected_call

```c
extern int umockcallrecorder_add_expected_call(UMOCKCALLRECORDER_HANDLE umock_call_recorder, UMOCKCALL_HANDLE mock_call);
```

**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_008: [** umockcallrecorder_add_expected_call shall add the mock_call call to the expected call list maintained by the call recorder identified by umock_call_recorder. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_009: [** On success umockcallrecorder_add_expected_call shall return 0. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_012: [** If any of the arguments is NULL, umockcallrecorder_add_expected_call shall fail and return a non-zero value. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_013: [** If allocating memory for the expected calls fails, umockcallrecorder_add_expected_call shall fail and return a non-zero value. **]**

##umockcallrecorder_add_actual_call

```c
extern int umockcallrecorder_add_actual_call(UMOCKCALLRECORDER_HANDLE umock_call_recorder, UMOCKCALL_HANDLE mock_call, UMOCKCALL_HANDLE* matched_call);
```

**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_014: [** umockcallrecorder_add_actual_call shall check whether the call mock_call matches any of the expected calls maintained by umock_call_recorder. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_015: [** If the call does not match any of the expected calls, then umockcallrecorder_add_actual_call shall add the mock_call call to the actual call list maintained by umock_call_recorder. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_016: [** If the call matches one of the expected calls, a handle to the matched call shall be filled into the matched_call argument. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_017: [** Comparing the calls shall be done by calling umockcall_are_equal. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_018: [** When no error is encountered, umockcallrecorder_add_actual_call shall return 0. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_019: [** If any of the arguments is NULL, umockcallrecorder_add_actual_call shall fail and return a non-zero value. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_020: [** If allocating memory for the actual calls fails, umockcallrecorder_add_actual_call shall fail and return a non-zero value. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_021: [** If umockcall_are_equal fails, umockcallrecorder_add_actual_call shall fail and return a non-zero value. **]**

##umockcallrecorder_get_actual_calls

```c
extern const char* umockcallrecorder_get_actual_calls(UMOCKCALLRECORDER_HANDLE umock_call_recorder);
```

**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_022: [** umockcallrecorder_get_actual_calls shall return a pointer to the string representation of all the actual calls. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_023: [** The string for each call shall be obtained by calling umockcall_stringify. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_024: [** If the umock_call_recorder is NULL, umockcallrecorder_get_actual_calls shall fail and return NULL. **]** 
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_025: [** If umockcall_stringify fails, umockcallrecorder_get_actual_calls shall fail and return NULL. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_026: [** If allocating memory for the resulting string fails, umockcallrecorder_get_actual_calls shall fail and return NULL. **]**

##umockcallrecorder_get_expected_calls

```c
extern const char* umockcallrecorder_get_expected_calls(UMOCKCALLRECORDER_HANDLE umock_call_recorder);
```

**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_027: [** umockcallrecorder_get_expected_calls shall return a pointer to the string representation of all the expected calls. **]**
**SRS_UMOCKCALLRECORDER_01_028: [** The string for each call shall be obtained by calling umockcall_stringify. **]**
